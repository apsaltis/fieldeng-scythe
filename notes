even data (time increments, spacing between bins) Kirk interpolate will generate the entire sequence
- if signal has 12 points, this one does OK if 4 points and each represent 1/3 of the 12.  
- think 4 qtrs in a year

if data sampled at same frequency 1 second bin then Vasili left join works it only interpolates missing bins.
- if data samples don't match like  March 15th vs March 30th 
- if you never get a match it won't work.  try catch for these scenarios



epoc   X axis,  millis  LONG

DOUBLE from only the end- start time of the interpolation signal
